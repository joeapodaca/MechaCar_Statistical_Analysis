## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The vehicle_length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg.

The p-Value of 5.35e-11 is below the threshhold of 0.05%. This rejects our null hypothesis and the shows that the slope is not zero.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
With today's high gas prices the MPG of the vehicle is the most important factor when deciding which vehicle to pushcase.  If gas prices rise then MPG is the top selling point.  To test this we would need to look at the vehicle's sold and compare the MPG of each vehicle.
